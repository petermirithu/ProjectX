# What We Did with Joel
- I first created my project.
- Joel then approved my first pr for "feature/add-homepage‚Äù to main branch.
- After than we all created a branch which we all edited the same line under the about us section.
- We then each raised pull requests. I merged Joel‚Äôs work first. So, I did not update my branch with his work. I then asked him to merge my work and it was there when we experience a merge conflict since we edited the same file and I did not have his work.
I had to resolve the conflict on git hub and then he approved my pr to be merged into main.
